/***
 * Converts the source spreadsheet for Tulsa's revenue data into JSON.
 * Data was provided by Nathan Pickard (Data Analyst) and Penny Macias (Project Manager) at the City of Tulsa.
 *
 * The budget worksheet has two sheets; the first is a summary of all of the subtotals for each revenue source
 * and category each year.  The second is what we really want; a table with all of the revenue sources that flow
 * to all of the different accounts ('funds') in the Tulsa accounting system.  For example, the penny sales tax
 * ratified in 2016 would be a 'revenue source' down the left side, and which fund that money landed in would be
 * listed along the top.  Most revenue sources only hit one or two funds, so it's normal to see zeros (for example,
 * you wouldn't expect sales taxes to land in the Intergovernmental Revenue fund).
 *
 * You'll hear 'funding source' from the folks at the City, when they say 'funding source,' they mean Fund, and
 * when they say 'revenue item' or 'revenue source,' they mean revenue source.
